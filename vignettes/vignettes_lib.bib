abstract = {In this paper we describe the OpenGeoSys (OGS) project, which is a scientific open-source initiative for numerical simulation of thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes in porous media. The basic concept is to provide a flexible numerical framework (using primarily the Finite Element Method (FEM)) for solving multifield problems in porous and fractured media for applications in geoscience and hydrology. To this purpose OGS is based on an object-oriented FEM concept including a broad spectrum of interfaces for pre- and postprocessing. The OGS idea has been in development since the mid-eighties. We provide a short historical note about the continuous process of concept and software development having evolved through Fortran, C, and C++ implementations. The idea behind OGS is to provide an open platform to the community, outfitted with professional software-engineering tools such as platform-independent compiling and automated benchmarking. A comprehensive benchmarking book has been prepared for publication. Benchmarking has been proven to be a valuable tool for cooperation between different developer teams, for example, for code comparison and validation purposes (DEVOVALEX and CO 2 BENCH projects). On one hand, object-orientation (OO) provides a suitable framework for distributed code development; however, the parallelization of OO codes still lacks efficiency. High-performance-computing efficiency of OO codes is subject to future research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Gaussian process (GP) models are commonly used statistical metamodels for emulating expensive computer simulators. Fitting a GP model can be numerically unstable if any pair of design points in the input space are close together. Ranjan, Haynes, and Karsten (2011) proposed a computationally stable approach for _tting GP models to deterministic computer simulators. They used a genetic algorithm based approach that is robust but computationally intensive for maximizing the likelihood. This paper implements a slightly modified version of the model proposed by Ranjan et al. (2011) in the R package GPfi t. A novel parameterization of the spatial correlation function and a clustering based multi- start gradient based optimization algorithm yield robust optimization that is typically faster than the genetic algorithm based approach. We present two examples with R codes to illustrate the usage of the main functions in GPfit. Several test functions are used for pesrformance comparison with the popular R package mlegp. We also use GPfit for a real application, i.e., for emulating the tidal kinetic energy model for the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada.

abstract = {The problem of validating computer simulation models of industrial systems has received only limited attention in the management science literature. The purpose of this paper is to consider the problem of validating computer models in the light of contemporary thought in the fields of philosophy of science, economic theory, and statistics. In order to achieve this goal we have attempted to gather together and present some of the ideas of scientific philosophers, economists, statisticians, and practitioners in the field of simulation which are relevant to the problem of verifying simulation models. We have paid particular attention to the writings of economists who have been concerned with testing the validity of economic models. Among the questions which we shall consider are included: What does it mean to verify a computer model of an industrial system? Are there any differences between the verification of computer models and the verification of other types of models? If so, what are some of these differ...},

@article{Ranjan2011,
abstract = {For many expensive deterministic computer simulators, the outputs do not have replication error and the desired metamodel (or statistical emulator) is an interpolator of the observed data. Realizations of Gaussian spatial processes (GP) are commonly used to model such simulator outputs. Fitting a GP model to n data points requires the computation of the inverse and determinant of n Ã— n correlation matrices, R, that are sometimes computationally unstable due to near-singularity of R. This happens if any pair of design points are very close together in the input space. The popular approach to overcome nearsingularity is to introduce a small nugget (or jitter) parameter in the model that is estimated along with other model parameters. The inclusion of a nugget in the model often causes unnecessary over-smoothing of the data. In this article, we propose a lower bound on the nugget that minimizes the over-smoothing and an iterative regularization approach to construct a predictor that further improves the interpolation accuracy. We also show that the proposed predictor converges to the GP interpolator. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Statistical Association and the American Society for Qualitys.},

abstract = {Thin films of TiO2 were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering. The thicknesses of the films were measured using alpha step profilometer technique. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) is used to determine the composition of the films. The influence of post-deposition annealing at 673 and 773 K on the structural, optical and Raman scattering was studied. The thicknesses of the films were found to be more or less the same irrespective of the annealing temperature and time. XRD results reveal the amorphous nature of the as-deposited film while the annealed samples were found to be crystalline with a tetragonal symmetry. Using the optical transmittance method, the optical constants such as band gap, refractive index and absorption coefficient were calculated and the influence of thermal annealing on these properties was reported. Raman study was employed to study the existence of different frequency modes and improvement of crystallinity of the TiO2 films and the effect of annealing temperature on the Raman shift is studied and reported.

abstract = {Big Data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {Many applications require optimizing an unknown, noisy function that is expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches. Copyright 2010 by the author(s)/owner(s).},
