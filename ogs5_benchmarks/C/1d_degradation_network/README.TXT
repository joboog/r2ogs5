When running the degradation network example, please make sure:
 * You have compiled the rf4.exe with "BRNS" precompiling flag
 * You have brnsdll.dll existing in the same folder

A discretization of dx=3.9mm and dt=216s is used. A constant
flux boundary condition is emulated by setting up appropriate
reactions at the inflow boundary node.

Some additional files included here are:
